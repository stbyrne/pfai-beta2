The former UCD and Dundalk man controlled the ball beautifully 30 yards out from goal before smashing his effort into the top corner but Liam Buckley says it's not the first time he has seen the midfielder score a cracking goal like that.\r\n \r\n\"He scores them in training but he just sometimes doesn't get far enough up the park. It was a wonderful strike. He won't get a better goal in his career.\"\r\n \r\nWhen speaking to the gathered media shortly after being mobbed by supporters after the final whistle had sounded Buckley was keen to thank the club for all the support they have given him over the past season.\r\n \r\n\"The club have been very good to me and my family. I was here as a player and then as an assistant with Brian Kerr and now I'm back here as a manager so it's great and I'm delighted for everyone involved.\"\r\n \r\nLast winter Pats had to undergo a complete reshuffle with m"},{"article_id":"5","article_headline":"PFAI launch new mobile app","article_image":"news_2.png","article_caption":"Chairman Stephen McGuiness","article_text":"The PFAI launched a new mobile app today designed to get information to their members quicker and more efficiently.\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

I've been trying to establish a possible squad that will be around up until the end of pre-season. Then we might try to whittle it down a little bit more,\u201d Dunne said.\r\n \r\nPreparations will begin early in the New Year, with the club grateful to be able to avail of the excellent facilities at either Salthill Devon or Mervue United as they get ready for a new beginning. Dunne\u2019s first appointment has already created a link with the recent past.\r\n \r\n\u201cI've brought in Adrian Craddock on the fitness side of things. He was involved with Mervue. I've heard good things and he is going to come in. I intend to contact around 30 players. I want to get them in and get them on off season programmes so that we can tick that box.\u201d\r\n \r\nMervue\u2019s third place finish last year gives Dunne hope that a competitive squad can be put together, and the initial response that he has received from potential squad members has been nothing but encouraging.\r\n \r\n\u201cThose who I have spoken to all seem to want to come on board. I think they know that it is an exciting time for Galway football. A lot of them were with Mervue and Salthill primarily, most who I have talked to.\r\n\r\n\u201cGalway for me was famous when I was playing coming down to play Galway United. The Galway name is always going to excite people. We just have to try to get moving and be competitive. These lads are very excited about it.\u201d\r\n \r\nExcited or not, the financial backing of the Comer brothers from Glenamaddy is the primary reason this venture has gotten off the ground, and its long term sustainability depends, as it always has done in a city where many sports vie for attention, on whether enough sup"},{"article_id":"9","article_headline":"'Exciting times at Turner's Cross' ahead","article_image":"news.png","article_caption":"Cork in action against Limerick","article_text":"Earlier today Gear\u00f3id Morrissey became the latest member of the 2013 Cork City squad to re-sign for the coming season when he put pen to paper on a new one year deal at the club.\r\n \r\nSpeculation had linked the former Blackburn Rovers player with the likes of St Patrick\u2019s Athletic and Shamrock Rovers as well as clubs across the water, but when Extratime.ie caught up with him this afternoon he revealed it was a relief to finally put the issue to bed and commit to the Rebel Army.\r\n \r\n\u201cYou know when you\u2019re juggling so many different options and things that could be happening, it becomes a bit overwhelming. It\u2019s constantly on the brain \u2013 when you\u2019re going to bed, and when you wake up it\u2019s the first thing you think about.\r\n \r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s good now because I know exactly what I\u2019m doing and now I can just concentrate on getting fit for pre-season.\u201d\r\n \r\nHaving signed on the dotted line, Morrissey\u2019s thoughts immediately turned to pre-season. With the club due to return to training on January 6th, the 22-year-old midfielder has already seen his new manager capture some exciting players and he is refusing to put a limit on what his side can achieve in 2014.\r\n \r\n\u201cTo be honest, I think there is really no limit for us. You see what Dundalk done last year, they wouldn\u2019t have been tipped to go on and do as well as they did.\r\n \r\n\u201cIt just goes to show that if you can make the right signings, you can get the team to gel, you get the right manager and coaches and you\u2019re training the right way and doing things right \u2013 why can\u2019t you go and win the league and why can\u2019t you be in the FAI Cup final?\u201d"}]}
